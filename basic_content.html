                During the assignment, we worked with the company <a class="link_in_text" href="https://foodsharingcph.org/" target="_blank">Foodsharing Copenhagen</a>. We worked in teams of four and we focused on creating a campaign website for this organization to educate about food waste problem.<br><br>We created a video that was supposed to show the problem and promote the Foodsharing Copenhagen organization. We made a storyboard for the video so it would be easier to produce it and better to visualize how we want the final video to look like.<br><br>We included the video on our interactive website which was designed in this clear and interactive way regarding to our target audience. To promote our website on social media, we made a short promo video to catch the attention of users.<br><br>At the end of the fifth theme, we gave a pitch to the customer – Foodsharing Copenhagen. We presented them with our solution – our campaign website with video.

                While working on the assignment we gained skills in Adobe Premiere Pro, we learned how to record a video – what to be aware of while working on it (e.g. lightning, sound).<br><br>We formed groups based on personality tests and created teams based on the results, so there would be someone from each type of personality (implementor in my case).<br><br>We created team canvas, distributed roles based on the results, we set our common goal, purpose and talked about weaknesses and strengths which was very helpful while working on the project.
