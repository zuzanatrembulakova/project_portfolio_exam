                During the assignment we worked with company Foodsharing Copenhagen. We worked in teams of four and we focused on creating campaign website for this organisation to educate about food waste problem.<br><br>We created a video which was supposed to show the problem and promote the Foodsharing Copenhagen organisation.  We made a storyboard for the video so it would be easier to produce it and better to visualise how we want the final video to look like.<br><br>We included the video on our interactive website which was designed in this clear and interactive way regarding to our target audience. To promote our website on social media, we made short promo video to catch attention of users.<br><br>At the end of the fifth theme we gave pitch to the customer – Foodsharing Copenhagen. We presented them our solution – our campaign website with video.

                While working on the assignment we gained skills in Adobe Premier Pro, we learned how to record a video – what to be aware of while working on it (e.g. lightning, sound).<br><br>We formed groups based on personality tests and created teams based on the results, so there would be someone from each type of personalities (implementor in my case).<br><br>We created team canvas, distributed roles based on the results, we set our common goal, purpose and talked about weaknesses and strengths which was very helpful while working on the project.
