                <p>This assignment was focusing on creating sprite animation in illustrator. I was inspired by a specific style of an artist and based on my inspiration I sketched my characters on paper and then I made them in illustrator. I made moodboard, so it would be easier for me to see my inspiration and design characters. I worked with different specific shapes and colors.<br><br>I design background, which consists of several layers and I put everything, character sprite, and background, together in CSS.</p>

                <p>The focus of the assignment was to create JavaScript controlled animation. I used my character from the previous task and applied ten different animations created in CSS on it.<br><br>It had to be obvious for the user how to turn the animation on and off and which animation was currently running. I included a sound when pressing a button.

                <p>I learned to implement sound in CSS and gained better skills in CSS animations and JavaScript.<br><br> While working on this assignment I was introduced to GitHub. I understood how to set up a project with Git and how GitHub works.

                <p>This was a one-day assignment where we worked in pairs. We were given several projects to choose from. I and my peers decided to work on a Drum Machine where we created buttons that could be pressed using specific keys on one’s keyboard.<br><br>After pressing a certain key, the sound is played. It also had to be clear for the user which sound is playing – which button is active.

                <p>I gained better skills with JavaScript– I learned how to play the sound after pressing keys on the keyboard.<br><br>We were working in pairs and we had to be done with the project in one day, so it was important to decide and work fast and effectively.

                <p>The focus of the assignment was to create an interactive and animated website, which through gamification helps a specific target audience.<br><br>We were working in teams of four. At the beginning, we made team canvas in which we distributed roles (Main coding done by me) for each member.<br><br>We finished the theme with this project and exhibition for teachers, other students and everyone interested.

                <p>We improved our skills in coding – JavaScript and CSS especially and got better in illustrator. We learned how to make an animated GIF in Photoshop which we included on social media to promote our website.<br><br>
                We gained new experiences while working in a group, creating team canvas at the beginning was very helpful.
