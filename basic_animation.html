                <p>This assignment was focusing on creating sprite animation in illustrator. I was inspired by specific style of an artist and based on my inspiration I sketched my characters on paper and then I made the in illustrator. I made moodboard, so it would be easier for me to see my inspiration and design characters. I worked with different specific shapes and colours.<br><br>I design background, which consists of several layers and I put everything, character sprite and background, together in CSS.

                <p>During this assignment I gained better skills while working with illustrator and making animation using @keyframes in CSS and I understood animation principles.

                <p>The focus of the assignment was to create javascript controlled animation. I used my character from previous task and applied ten different animation created in CSS on it.<br><br>It had to be obvious for the user how to turn the animation on and off and which animation was currently running. I included a sound when pressing a button

                <p>I learned implementing sound in CSS and gained better skill in CSS animations and in javascript.<br><br>While working on this assignment I was introduced to GitHub. I understood how to set up a project with Git and how GitHub works

                <p>This was a one-day assignment where we worked in pairs. We were given several projects to choose from. Me and my peer decided to work on a Drum Machine where we created buttons which could be pressed using specific keys on one’s keyboard.<br><br>After pressing certain key, the sound is played. It also had to be clear for the user which sound is playing – which button is active.

                <p>I gained better skills with javascript – I learned how to play the sound after pressing keys on keyboard.<br><br>We were working in pairs and we had to be done with project in one day, so it was important to decide and work fast and effectively.
