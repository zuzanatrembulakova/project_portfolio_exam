                <p>The focus of this assignment was to create a prototype of a website. We were working in a group of three people. Firstly, we researched conventions regarding the content, design, and functionality of our website to provide a good user experience for our target audience.<br><br>We created style tile and wireflows for better visualizing our prototype. To test our prototype, we used the ‘Think Aloud Test’ to know possible improvements we would make based on the results.

                <p>When working on the assignment we gained better skills while working with Adobe XD and learned the importance of adapting the website to the specific audience. We researched relevant information regarding digital communication targeted towards our target audience, that we used accordingly in our solution.

                <p>This theme was focused on creating a prototype following the 5-day Design sprint method – from mapping, through sketching, deciding to prototype. We were working in groups of 7 people this time and our job was to create an app that would improve a student’s life for KEA students.<br><br>On the last day of the sprint, we gave a 7-minute clear pitch of our solution, where we introduced our team and included the problem and solution we came up with to the problem for our target audience

                <p>During this assignment, I was introduced to the Design sprint method. I was able to work at a fast pace and coming with ideas using the Design sprint method which was very useful.<br><br>We were working in a team of 7 people where each of us had a specific role. The roles were well distributed and decided at the beginning of the project. The facilitator led our team and the decider (myself) helped with tough decisions. We made team canvas, where we decided on roles for each member and set goal, purpose, and rules.
